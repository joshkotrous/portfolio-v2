# Leading Effective 1:1s

## Introduction

Throughout your career as a software engineer, _hopefully_ you’re already familiar with the one-on-one meeting with your manager. If you haven’t had a one-on-one meeting with your direct leader, perhaps you should ask them why! Now as an Engineering Manager, one of your core responsibilities is to meet one-on-one with each of your direct reports for at least 30 minutes on a weekly basis. These meetings are imperative in supporting your team by ensuring each developer has the tools they need to be successful. This can come in many forms including fielding technical questions, reviewing code, and clearing blockers - but also on a more personal level handling unexpected personal situations or internal conflicts. In this article I will dissect the developer one-on-one meeting and hope to leave you with some takeaways to apply to your own one-on-ones to make them more effective and the best use of your time.

## Be Prepared

Although generally more informal in nature, one-on-ones are still just as important as any other meeting on your calendar. Be on time and avoid rescheduling this meeting. Your developer’s time is valuable and they may be counting on this meeting to bring important items to your attention. It’s also important to ensure you’re adequately prepared for the one-on-one ahead of time to make the best use of the time. Spend 15 minutes before the meeting to create an agenda with discussion points you have and check with your direct report for any items they want to discuss so you can plan accordingly with the time you have allotted. It may be the case you don’t have any agenda items and that’s okay - but the meeting should still happen. Use this time to get an update on projects, identify any potential unforeseen issues, and check in with your direct report on how they’re doing professional and personally - it’s not always about work after all. Developing good relationships with your team will improve overall morale and show that you care about them as people too.

## Ask for and give feedback

Another important aspect of the one-on-one is it’s the most effective time to give and receive feedback with your direct report. Throughout the week pay attention for positive feedback and areas of improvement from other members of the team and incorporate this feedback into the meeting. When discussing areas of improvement, always be sure to lead with positive intent and seek to understand your direct report’s point of view. This will help you gracefully deliver the feedback and be sure to follow up to ensure it was effective. Giving feedback is just as important as asking for it too. Check in with your direct report on how you’re doing as a leader and ask if there’s any way you can better support them in their role. Internalize this feedback and hold yourself accountable for applying it in your day-to-day activities. This continuous feedback loop aids implementing feedback when it’s first identified preventing large issues from developing.

## Take Notes

The one-on-one meeting is only as effective as the output you apply following it but we all have a full plate and it would be impossible for anyone to remember every detail of the meeting. This is why I emphasize the importance of taking effective notes during your one-on-one. Taking notes will make it easier to follow up on past conversations, can be easily compiled as updates to other stakeholders, and can be incorporated into performance reviews. I have a template I personally use, feel free to incorporate it into your own notes:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Discuss:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

&nbsp;

| Project | Due Date | Status | Blockers/Next Steps | Cross Functional Partners |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| &nbsp;  |          |        |                     |                           |
| &nbsp;  |          |        |                     |                           |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action Items:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

&nbsp;

Be mindful though that your note taking is not interrupting the flow of the meeting or taking away too much of your attention. If needed it can be helpful to take your notes in scratch on paper then transcribe them to the template when you have time. This method will allow you to keep your full attention on the meeting while also keeping the data from those meetings recorded in an organized fashion.

## Let the Engineer Talk

Although you often times may have lots of important topics to discuss, it’s also important to remember not to take up the entire time talking at the other person. As mentioned before check in with your direct report ahead of time to see what points they may have to discuss and plan accordingly. The purpose of this meeting is to support the engineer in their workload and career - give them the stage to ask for the help they need.

## Follow Up

Finally, the one-on-ones you have each week should be a continuation of the previous meeting. Utilize the notes you’ve taken to circle back to previous discussions. Follow up on blockers and feedback to check that they have been solved or implemented accordingly. This allows you to hold your direct report accountable and prevent action items from falling into the void.

## Conclusion

Effective one-on-one meetings are one of the foundations of building a positive working experience for engineers on your team. By integrating these principles into your one-on-ones, you can increase their efficacy, thereby bolstering support for your team members in their career development. This, in turn, ultimately leads to higher output and productivity.
